      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <bioghist>
        <p>Frank Leonard Stick (10 February 1884-12 November 1966) was born in Huron, South Dakota, to David L Stick (1853-1914) and Lydia Jane Marcellus Stick (1852-1942). He had one brother, Daniel C. Stick (1879-1913). Frank Stick's family moved to Illinois in 1899, where he spent much of his time in the outdoors, hunting, fishing, and camping. He demonstrated a talent for art an early age. In his late teens, he moved to Chicago to study art and sold his first illustration to <emph render="italic">Sports Afield </emph>magazine when he was nineteen. He also studied under notable illustrator Howard Pyle in Wilmington, Delaware, for a time. His studies with Powell helped develop the specialized techniques he employed in the field of outdoor illustration. Stick soon made a career selling his paintings to sporting magazines and other publications, such as the <emph render="italic">Saturday Evening Post </emph>and <emph render="italic">Ladies Home Journal.</emph> Known for his paintings of dogs, Stick also produced illustrations for the short stories of Albert Payson Terhune and the Anti-Vivisection League of America.<lb/><lb/>In addition to his work as a painter, Stick was also an accomplished writer, and he contributed numerous editorial articles to <emph render="italic">Field and Stream </emph>and co-authored a book on surf fishing entitled <emph render="italic">The Call of the Surf. </emph>Throughout his life he wrote numerous vignettes, articles, and books on the topics of cancer prevention, beach erosion, fishing and hunting, ichthyology, and conservation, most of which remain unpublished.<lb/><lb/>Stick married Maud Hayes Stick in 1908, and the couple had two children: Charlotte Stick McMullan (1909-1969) and David Stick (1919-2009). In the early 1920s, with a group of other Howard Pyle students, Stick established an informal artists' colony in Interlaken, New Jersey, where he was elected the first mayor in 1922. A fishing trip in the mid-1920s brought him to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where he became so enchanted with the area that he began buying up large tracts of property in Dare County. He retired from painting in 1929 and moved his family to the Skyco area of Roanoke Island. He then focused his career on real estate development and construction, and he became known for his modernist designs for simple flat top cottages. He was instrumental in the development of the communities of Virginia Dare Shores and Southern Shores. He co-founded several companies engaged in real estate development, including Kitty Hawk Development Company/Kitty Hawk Land Company, Southern Shores Realty Company, and Hatteras Holding Corporation.<lb/><lb/>Stick was an avid conservationist and spent much of his free time advocating for the preservation of the Outer Banks' natural resources. In 1933, Stick began to campaign for the establishment of a national park along the Outer Banks and began procuring extensive land holdings that would ultimately form the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. In establishing the park, one of Stick's goals was to protect and stabilize the area's fragile dunes, and he pioneered the design and construction of sand fences along the seashore, in addition to planting beach grasses for dune stabilization. He was also instrumental in bringing in transient and WPA work forces to engage in conservation work in the park. Stick was largely opposed to beach renourishment projects that involved bringing in sand, encouraging efforts to protect dunes as they stood rather than attempting to artificially extend the shoreline.<lb/><lb/>Stick returned to art in the early 1940s. His interest in ichthyology inspired the creation of nearly three hundred watercolor sketches of the fish he identified. He also drafted a book based on this work entitled <emph render="italic">Fishes of Atlantic and Caribbean Waters</emph>, which was never published. A revised version was eventually published under the title <emph render="italic">An Artist's Catch </emph>by his son, David, utilizing his famous fish watercolors as illustrations.<lb/><lb/>In his later life. Stick spent a great deal of his free time in the Florida Keys and the Virgin Islands. In the early 1950s, he began working closely with Laurance Rockefeller and other interested parties to acquire land holdings on the island of St. John, which were originally intended to be developed into a resort community. However, as Stick recalls in a 9 October 1960 letter to a business associate, Allston Boyer, "But one day as I sat on an out-cropping watching a bulldozer cut a red gash along the base of Old Bordeaux Mountain, visualization of what the future might bring came to me, and I determined then and there that this lovely island would not become a symbol of man's commercial desecration, if I could help it" (this letter can be found in the Correspondence, 1959-1963 folder of this collection, in the Virgin Islands National Park subseries of Stick's papers). Together Stick, Rockefeller, and several other property owners on the island worked to establish the Virgin Islands National Park in 1956.<lb/><lb/>Stick remained active as both a watercolorist and a realtor until the end of his life. He passed away in November 1966 in Dare County at the age of 82. He is buried alongside his wife and daughter in Austin Cemetery in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</p>

            <p>The Conservation subseries contains material related to Frank Stick's various conservation interests and the initiatives in which he participated. Most of the materials in this series relate to Stick's work to establish national parks on North Carolina's Outer Banks (the Cape Hatteras National Seashore) and the island of St. John (Virgin Islands National Park), but documentation of Stick's interest in erosion control and wildlife conservation, as well as papers related to various projects in the state of Florida in which he was interested are included. The bulk of the material is correspondence, but maps, reports and other publications, legal documents, and clippings are also included.</p>

              <p>The Cape Hatteras National Seashore subseries, 1935-1963, contains materials documenting Frank Stick's attempts to establish a national park on the Outer Banks south of Oregon Inlet. Papers primarily consist of correspondence, largely written or received by Frank Stick, relating to land acquisition, lobbying efforts, conservation measures, and project planning. Several letters in this subseries document the complicated social history of the park, such as local opposition to the establishment of an African American Civilian Conservation Corps camp and concerns about the "transient class" representing the Works Progress Administration's labor base. In addition to correspondence, drafts and published copies of legislation, maps, and isolated records of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore Commission are also included.</p>

                <p>This folder primarily consists of letters written by Frank Stick, in his capacity as secretary of the commission, to R. Bruce Etheridge and other representatives with an interest in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Many of Stick's letters express his discomfort that the language of the proposed bill to establish the park would result in overhunting of waterfowl, while others discuss work done to recruit donations and survey land holdings on Ocracoke to be included in the park. In a 24 June 1940 letter to Etheridge, Stick describes "the old negro, Bryant, head of the only colored family on Ocracoke Island" who wished to contribute his land to the project. Stick remarks that "here is some darned good publicity if properly handled." In addition to correspondence, the folder includes typed transcripts of data related to the commission (such as budgetary and membership information), drafts and published copies of bills and amendments, and a map of the area covered by the project.<lb/></p>

                <p>These materials comprise correspondence between Frank Stick, State and National Park Service personnel, and prospective property donors regarding establishing a state park in the area now known as the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Many of the letters are from John S. Phipps, who owned a 4,000-acre tract of land on Hatteras Island, including the J.D. Dailey Tract desired by the National Park Service for the park. The establishment of a state park on Hatteras Island was viewed by project organizers as a precursory step to creating a national park there.<lb/><lb/>Many of the letters in this folder discuss protective measures to be taken to guard the seashore from erosion and the establishment of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp to assist with this work, including some discussion pertinent to race relations in the area. In a 17 June 1935 letter, Stick remarks that "While a negro CCC camp would probably do as much work as a white camp, we feel that it should not be established on the banks...I believe I can say with complete confidence that a negro camp will not be placed in the Hatteras area." Establishment of a camp was denied in June 1935, possibly (according to Stick) due to concerns over whether it would be staffed by African American workmen.<lb/></p>

                <p>This folder consists of correspondence related to the use of Works Progress Administration (WPA) laborers in creating the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Letters primarily discuss the supervisory responsibility associated with bringing in WPA workers and the general oversight of the project. In his letters, Stick expresses concern with the lack of qualified leaders allocated to oversee the unskilled laborers hired by the WPA, stating in one letter (9 January 1936), "...no class is more dependent upon leadership impossible to provide from the Transient class."</p>

              <p>The Virgin Islands National Park subseries, 1932-1963 and undated (bulk 1952-1959) contains materials created or collected by Frank Stick over the course of his campaign to establish a national park on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Most of this subseries consists of correspondence, but brochures, event programs, reports, maps, publications, clippings, and legal documents are also included. Much of the correspondence is between Frank Stick and Allston Boyer, an associate of the Rockefellers, resort planner, and conservationist who helped develop several national parks in addition to Virgin Islands National Park. Letters to National Park Service superintendent Conrad Wirth, letters from Stick to various government officials, and correspondence between Stick and property owners who sold land acquired for the park are also included. Additionally, many of the letters in this subseries related to the operations of the Lameshur estate, a property purchased by Laurance Rockefeller with the intention of establishing a park and managed by the Stick family. Drafts of articles written by Stick on St. John and the Virgin Islands National Park can be found in the Writings series.</p>

                <p>Letters primarily discuss a heated dispute between the Folks and Frank Faulk, owner of the Reef Bay estate on St. John, for which the Folks served as caretakers until May 1953. Following the dispute, the Folks moved to the adjacent Lameshur Estate where they were retained by Stick as caretakers. The letters discuss improvements made to both properties and the daily tasks of the Folks as they carried out their duties on St. John.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Writings series, 1924-1965 and undated, contains drafts and manuscript fragments, correspondence, clippings, and research material related to Stick's various writing projects. Stick's writings primarily relate to his interests in ichthyology and conservation, but other topics are also covered. The series is arranged into two subseries: Ichthyology, 1950-1965 and undated; and Articles and Other Writings, 1924-1963 and undated. Most of the undated material likely dates from the latter part of Stick's life, circa 1950s-1960s.</p>

              <p>The Ichthyology subseries, 1950-1965 and undated, contains drafts and research materials related to Stick's study of ichthyology. Particularly, much of the material in this subseries relates to Stick's book, <emph render="italic">Fishes of Atlantic and Caribbean Waters</emph>, which was never published, despite several publishers expressing interest in it. Included in this series is correspondence between Stick and publishers, scholars, ichthyologists, and other individuals interested in the study of fish; drafts of Stick's book and other writings on fish; and research materials. Drafts are undated, but likely date from the mid-1950s. Related to Stick's study of ichthyology are his watercolor paintings of fish, which can be found in the Artwork series of this collection.</p>

              <p>The Articles and Other Writings subseries, 1924-1963 and undated, contains correspondence, clippings, and drafts of articles, vignettes, affidavits, and other short pieces written by Frank Stick on subjects besides ichthyology. Most materials are undated but appear to date from around the 1950s-early 1960s. Some of the pieces in this subseries are unidentified, and some folders contain only fragments. Many of the writings in this subseries relate to conservation and beach erosion control, particularly in the wake of the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, including one unidentified manuscript of a book (or series of articles) on erosion control, written near the end of Stick's life, in which he expresses discomfort with beach renourishment as an erosion control method. This manuscript draft appears to be incomplete and extremely disordered. One unpublished story entitled "The Man in the White Suit" recounts a young Stick's chance encounter with Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain), whom Stick believes convinced the staff of Century magazine to hire him as an illustrator. Also included in this subseries are two folders of material related to cancer prevention, including correspondence, research material, and drafts of a diet plan and an unpublished book by Stick entitled <emph render="italic">Cancer: A Preventable Disease</emph>.</p>

              <p>The Real Estate subseries, 1926-1966 and undated, contains records related to Stick's career in real estate and land speculation. Materials include correspondence, deeds, abstracts of title, purchase and sale agreements, financial records, blueprints and plans, and other papers. Much of the correspondence is between Stick and his associates in Kitty Hawk Land Co./Kitty Hawk Development Co., including David Stick, N. Elton Aydlett, John B. McMullan, and Cyrus Aydlett. Other correspondence is between Stick and various homeowners regarding specifications for improvements or design elements for their homes. Included in this series is extensive documentation of the early development of the town of Southern Shores and the Virginia Dare Shores community, as well as numerous deeds documenting the chain of early ownership of tracts on the northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island. Researchers can find many more real estate records related to Kitty Hawk Land Co., Hatteras Holding Corporation, and Southern Shores Realty Co., including additional papers created by Frank Stick, in PC.5001 David Stick Papers.</p>

              <p>Reny and James Hill, family friends of the Sticks, corresponded with Frank Stick briefly in 1954 concerning the possibility of retiring to the Virgin Islands. A letter from Reny Hill, dated 18 May 1954, expresses interest in the idea but concern over the potential for racial inequity and an atmosphere of subjugation to develop between the island's natives and the white retirees that would eventually settle there. Hill goes on to discuss increased racial tensions in St. Thomas, stating "I don't think a native of an idyllic island should be willing to trade his dignity and way of life for the prosperity of acting as servant to white householders." In a reply drafted on 9 June of that year, Stick states that "I believe now that our United States is in the gravest danger it has been in since the signing of the declaration of independence, and I believe in my heart that the danger from within is more serious than from without;" and, in a later draft of the same letter, Stick remarks that "I swing more sharply to the left even than Maud or my children, and I think you may appreciate the difficulties I have encountered here in Dare County, where traditional intolerances are so strongly manifested and where the word democracy has little significance other than its worn out defence [sic] of white supremacy." In addition to racism, the letters in this folder discuss plans for the development of the Lameshur Estate, McCarthyism, Communism, and other political and social issues of the time.<lb/></p>
