                  <div id="d3e113" class="section showhide" style="display: block;"><b>John Hazard Carson (1752 - 1841)</b> arrived in America in 1773 from his native Scotland. After a two-year stay in Pennsylvania
                     he made his way to North Carolina. Carson settled in Burke County - then on the colonial
                     frontier - at the time of the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />In 1778 Carson married Rachel Matilda McDowell (1756 - 1795) of Burke County, the
                     daughter of "Hunting John" McDowell (who acquired this nickname due to his superior
                     knowledge of the area's hunting grounds) and sister of Joseph McDowell who gained
                     notoriety at the Battle of King's Mountain. That same year he began toamass property
                     through a series of land grants. He built a two-story eight-room log cabin where he
                     lived with his growing family for 15 years.<br /><br />John and Rachel had seven children; Joseph McDowell Carson (1779 - 1860); Jason Hazard
                     Carson (1782 - 1831), James Carson, Rebecca Carson, John W. Carson, Charles Carson
                     (died 1850), and Sarah Carson (1788 - 1840). Around 1793, John Carson received a land
                     grant on Buck and Clear creeks and began to construct a new home, however his wife
                     Rachel died before it was finished.<br /><br />Following the death of his first wife, he married Mary Moffett McDowell (1768 - 1825),
                     widow of the aforementioned Joseph McDowell of Pleasant Gardens, a nearby plantation.
                     She transferred this name to the Carson home, previously known as Garden Hill. From
                     this second union, five children were born. Samuel Price Carson (1798 - 1838); Matilda
                     M. Carson ( b. 1799); William Moffett Carson (1801 - 1863), George Moffett Carson
                     (circa 1805 - 1863), and Jonathan Logan Carson (circa 1807 - 1866).<br />Pleasant Gardens was one of the largest and most productive plantations in the region.
                     Through the years John Hazard Carson added to his land holdings and enlarged his house.
                     While Carson traded in livestock and other market goods from his plantation, he may
                     have operated the house as a roadside inn and tavern as early as 1808. The Carsons
                     and McDowells were also formidable horsemen and adept with fire arms making them successful
                     hunters. In addition, they raced thoroughbred horses and created race-paths through
                     their extensive land holdings.<br /><br />Carson grew corn, made and sold whiskey, beer and brandy. He also ran a grist mill
                     and saw mill on Bucks Creek and rented his unused fields for income. Carson was involved
                     in local community affairs, having served in the 1780s as a justice of the peace,
                     magistrate, administrator of several estates, bondsman and juror. He was also active
                     at the state level, serving as one of five elected Burke County representatives to
                     the Constitutional Convention in 1789 and was a member of the House of Commons in
                     1805-1806.<br /><br />In addition to housing the Carson family, Pleasant Gardens was home to slaves whose
                     labor was needed operate the plantation. Carson's slave holdings grew with his land
                     and investments, increasing from 12 slaves in 1790 to 68 in 1841. Census data indicates
                     that Carson's sons also owned slaves. The 1860 census enumerates the slaveholders
                     as follows: George M. Carson, age 55, farmer, 40 slaves, 7 slave houses; J.L. Carson
                     age 53 farmer, 28 slaves; and William M. Carson, agent, 19 slaves.<br />Another venture in which the Carsons were involved was the mining of gold, which was
                     discovered in the piedmont and western North Carolina in the early 1800s. They purchased
                     several acres in the vicinity of Brindletown in Burke County. The Carsons, along with
                     other slaveholders, had thousands of slaves working the mines. Joseph McDowell Carson
                     accumulated most of his wealth via gold and was said to have mined over $1 million
                     during his lifetime.<br /><br />In 1841 Colonel Carson died, leaving his house and land to Jonathan Logan Carson,
                     his youngest child. Sometimes cited as J.L. or Logan, Carson donated 50 acres east
                     of Pleasant Gardens for the creation of the town of Marion in the new county of McDowell.
                     The Carson house served as the county's first courthouse. Jonathan Logan also added
                     Greek revival features to the double-pen log house and removed the old gable roof.
                     The log walls were covered with siding on the exterior and tongue-in-groove sheeting
                     on the interior. The house has been preserved and is now administered by the Carson
                     House Society.<br /><br />===============================================================================<br /><br /><b>Joseph McDowell Carson (1779 - 1860)</b> served in both the North Carolina House and Senate. Much of his wealth was accumulated
                     by mining gold. He married Rebecca Wilson daughter of James Wilson and Ruth Davidson,
                     sister of Catherine Wilson, and granddaughter of Samuel Davidson. He built Green River
                     Plantation and raised his family of six there as well as harbored family members and
                     guests.<br /><br /><b>Jason Hazard Carson (1782 - 1830)</b> was a landowner and slave owner who farmed with his father and his brothers. He married
                     Mary Hawkins Cowden Carson (1786 - 1853). They are buried at Clinton Cemetery in central
                     Mississippi.<br /><b>James Carson,</b> little is known.<br /><b>Rebecca Carson </b>married Thomas "Big Tom" McEntyre, who was reportedly a rough man and an unsuitable
                     husband. She left him and moved into her brother's home Green River. Rebecca petitioned
                     for a portion of her father's estate and was awarded 4 slaves and $1,000.<br /><br /><b>John W. Carson (d. 1836)</b> farmed with his brothers and made several trips to Charleston to sell livestock.
                     He studied medicine and began a medical practice and was also listed in documents
                     as an innkeeper and merchant. <br /><b>Charles Carson (d. 1850)</b> was a small farmer and was also involve to a lesser degree in mining.<br /><br /><b>Sarah "Sally" Carson (pr. 1788 - 1840)</b> married General William Davidson Smith of Burke County who descended from pioneer
                     families. They migrated to the Republic of Texas and had 6 children.<br /><br /><b>Samuel Price Carson (1798 - 1838)</b> was born at Pleasant Gardens but moved to the Green River Plantation where he was
                     educated under the direction of his brother Joseph. Samuel was elected to the North
                     Carolina Senate in 1922, and served 4 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives 1825
                     - 1833. After an unsuccessful bid at re-election in 1833, he returned to the state
                     Senate. <br /><br />Carson faced Dr. Robert B. Vance in his first run for re-election to Congress and
                     during some rancorous politicking, Vance insinuated that Carson's father, John Hazard
                     Carson had loyalist sympathies during the revolution. This caused Carson to challenge
                     Vance to a duel. The men met at Saluda Gap, South Carolina. Vance took a bullet between
                     the ribs and died the following day. It was said that killing Dr. Vance had a profound
                     effect on Carson and ushered in his period of his physical decline.<br /><br />He married Catherine Wilson in 1831. They had one daughter, Rebecca, and adopted his
                     daughter Emily, born out of wedlock to Emma Trout. On the advice of family friend
                     Davy Crockett of Tennessee, Carson moved to Texas with Catherine and their daughters
                     and a slave named Eliza Carson. <br /><br />He was elected Secretary of the State of the Republic of Texas, but was released from
                     that position because of his ill health. Following Samuel's death, the family returned
                     to McDowell County. Carson County, Texas was named for Samuel Price Carson.<br /><br /><b>Matilda Carson (pr. b. 1799)</b> married Jason Wilson.<br /><br /><b>William Moffett Carson (1801 - 1863)</b> married his cousin Almyra Wilson. To this union seven children were born. After her
                     death, he married Catherine Wilson Carson, his brother's widow. They had two children.
                     Although he served in the State Legislature and held a number of public offices, farming
                     was his primary interest. Carson amassed large land holdings and many slaves. <br /><br /><b>George Moffett Wilson (d. 1863)</b> was provided for in his father's will and with his inheritance he purchased land
                     which grew in value. His wealth also grew as the number of his slaves increased. He
                     served as postmaster at Pleasant Gardens from 1830 - 1844. Never married, he bequeathed
                     his land and slaves to his nieces and nephews.<br /><br /><b>Jonathan Logan Carson (1807 - 1866)</b> was the main recipient of his father's inheritance and received the family home.
                     He owned much land, although not as much as his father. J.L. Carson raised cattle
                     and operated mills for grinding grain and sawing lumber. He also continued to use
                     part of the house as an inn and boarding house with considerable draw due to its location
                     between Morganton and Asheville.<br /><br />Carson married Mary Sturdivant Presnell (1812 - 1907). They had two children, Harriett
                     and Margaret. They were present when Union soldiers raided the Carson home in the
                     final days of the Civil War. A written account of the event was made by teacher Emma
                     Rankin.<br /><br />J.L. Carson died intestate in 1866, and the settlement of his estate was long and
                     drawn out with a large number of people making claims.<b>Sources:</b> Texas State Historical Association, ; Michael R. Hill, ; ; John Hugh McDowell, , US Census records.
